# local_bulkcompletions
Bulk Completions Web Service for Moodle

This Moodle plugin extends the capabilities of Moodle's built-in web service API.  It allows you to query for completions per course.

This functionality may be useful to anyone using Moodle to deliver online education, who then wishes to track completion of that education in a different system.

To install, we recommend ZIPping the whole repository (root of ZIP contains one folder: local_bulkcompletions), and using Moodle's plugin management functions under 'Site Administration'.
